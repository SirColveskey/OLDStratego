Basically what you did in yours.

wait for spacebar with a covered display.

^^^NOTE THIS IS A COPY PASE WHICH WE SHOULD REMOVE BY A DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION/FUNCTION CALL

//GetMove basics:
Get a position from mouse click
If this position contains a moveable piece select it
Player should be able to cancel a selection with a right click
If next click is a left click (not right) get the position
Check if the position is a valid move for the piece, if it is not loop back around
If so move the piece, if it is an enemy call SelectedPiece.Attack(Piece at target location)
If an attack occured display a panel or animation saying the rank of the two peices and the result.
***We need a way to inform the player who was attacked of the piece rank, perhaps put the last move somewhere in the UI

//Piece.Attack basics:
If target.rank == flag call FlagCapture(attackers color)
If target.rank == Bomb && rank != 8
	return -1
else If target == Bomb
	return 1
else If target.rank < rank
	return 1
else If target.rank > rank
	return -1
else
	return 0
